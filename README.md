# Introduction
Collection of fat kernels for deep learning writen in triton.
Looking forward accelerating the neural networks that we use in our day to day basis; by going beyond optimizations given by DL frameworks like pytorch: e.g.: by fusing kernels, and making big fat kernels that run on NVIDIA GPUs.
